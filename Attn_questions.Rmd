Initial Interest: 
Would it be accurate to use the intercept of the glm's for habituation to state initial interest? When the intercept is significant, that number is the value for initial interest? 
Is there a better way of doing this? 
Discrimination: 
advice for which transformation to use
is it appropriate to choose some to transform and not others?
what should by alpha level be for these comparisons? Is there some bootstrapping guideline for that? 

What are good ways to get rid of outliers? What are guidelines for getting rid of outliers? (tc_ts_tc)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
